Simple and easy code that extracts soundtrack from single / multiple videosðŸŽ¬
I guess I'd create a readme later... The old one got covered after I learnt how to use git push lol

oh and in case u don't know how to use, just run gui.py. If it generates an error, run tryinitffmpeg.py with admin and then run gui.py.

oh oh oh and you may wonder why the fuck does this seem to be like a python program but has mostly HTML / C code component. It's because I just put the ffmpeg source in it (by BtbN). This will be needed in the future, probably. (And also now) (Oh I changed it in gitattributes! wow)

now everything combined!!!

want to save space or try out convinient and interesting functions? try this program!

Current available functions: Audio Extraction from Video, auto download audio files from Bilibili & Youtube, auto initialization of ffmpeg (creating path on computer), Audio File edit (length, volume, speed, loop, fade) and advanced processing (3D sound effect, compression)
