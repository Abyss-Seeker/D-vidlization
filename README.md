Simple and easy code that extracts soundtrack from single / multiple videosðŸŽ¬
I guess I'd create a readme later... The old one got covered after I learnt how to use git push lol

oh and in case u don't know how to use, just run gui.py. If it generates an error, run tryinitffmpeg.py with admin and then run gui.py.
