# Extract-MP3 (Vid2MP3 and more!)
Simple and easy code that extracts soundtrack from single / multiple videos ðŸŽ¬

Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to extract-mp3, a fun and easy-to-use program that lets you extract the soundtracks of your favorite videos and save them as mp3 or wav files. Whether you want to listen to music from your favorite movies or create your own soundtracks, extract-mp3 has got you covered.

## How to Use  ðŸ”§
Using extract-mp3 is super easy. Here's what you need to do:

###1. Install the required dependencies by running **pip install moviepy**  (as this code relies on it)
###2. Navigate to the directory where your video files are stored (or maybe, the directory of a single video file). Copy the directory.
###3. Run the program by running python by the directory 
3.1 Just follow the instructions and input the directory you copied and the output directory you want (entering nothing would result in the output being in the default directory (you can find that in the config section of code)
3.2 PLEASE DO NOT PUT ' or " on both sides of the directory!
###4. Sit back, relax, and let the code do the rest!

## Supported Formats ðŸ“¹
extract-mp3 supports the following video formats:
**- .webm
- .mov
- .mp4
- .avi
- .ogv
- .mkv**

## Output ðŸ’¾
You can alter the output form in the "config" section in the code. All outputs moviepy supports are available (mp3, wav, etc.)
Once the program is done extracting the soundtracks, the resulting mp3 or wav files will be saved in the same directory as the video files.

## Have Fun! ðŸ˜Š
Yes, yes, I know my code is kinda shit. But it is at least working on my windows and I am still learning! :D

I hope you enjoy using extract-mp3 as much as we enjoyed creating it. Feel free to customize and modify the program to suit your needs. And if you run into any issues, please don't hesitate to post in the issues section.
