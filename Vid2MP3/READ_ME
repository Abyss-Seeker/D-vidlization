This logic behind this isn't that hard, in fact, you can probably understand this easily.
The code uses moviepy to extract the background music and os to do this in large quantities under one directory.
I initially coded this for to extract mp3 files from Made in Abyss OSTs :)

The variables can be configured, and you can change the output file type to .wav / .mp3 in the config...
I haven't experienced it with Mac though, don't know if there would be bugs.
